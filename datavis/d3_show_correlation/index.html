        <div class="title">A broad look at every single survey respondent—each one represented by a single black dot.</div>
	The distance between each dot indicates the relationship between each respondent; the closer the dots, the more similar they are in behavior.

        <div class="title">Birds of a feather, dots of a color. Blue dots denote respondents who are most familiar with BET—and most likely to join our side.
	</div>
	Potential BET fans tend to congregate on one side of our chart, indicating a clearly distinct set of attitudes and preferences.

        <div class="title">When we layer in all potential BET fans, with varying levels of familiarity with our programming, the separation becomes more distinct.
	</div>
	This means we can explore exactly what behavioral factors differentiate a likely fan from a non-fan—and build a model to predict who’s most likely to join our ranks.

        <div class="title">My Talk</div>
        Here are all 5,040 words of my talk.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">My Stumbles</div>
        And here are all the fillers I used in those 30 minutes.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Um's, Ah's &amp; Uh's</div>
        I almost exclusively used these three fillers. Um's and Ah's made up over 80%, with Uh's trailing behind.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Fillers Over Time</div>
        I hoped that all these blunders were toward the beginning of my talk. And the data suggests that fewer fillers are used as I get into it. Perhaps the talk started out rough and improved as I found my groove.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Ramping Back Up</div>
        Unfortunately, the trend does not continue. Midway into the talk my Um's and Ah's spike. I continue to use them pretty consistently throughout the rest of the talk.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">The Cough Effect</div>
        My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Best of Luck to Me in 2015</div>
        The world may never know, or care, but hopefully these insights improve my speaking in 2015. Though preliminary results aren't looking so good.
